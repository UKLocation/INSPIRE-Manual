#What is INSPIRE?
##INSPIRE is an infrastructure for sharing spatial data in Europe

The geographical information held by European countries does not currently join up - but the environment does. Environmental issues such as flooding, forest fires and climate change do not respect national borders.

The principal aim of INSPIRE is to improve environmental policy making in Europe by standardising how geographical information is managed and made available.

The EU INSPIRE Directive (2007/2/EC), and associated UK Regulations, place legal obligations on public authorities which hold geographical data about the environment and things that affect the environment. 

The definition of environment is broad and INSPIRE includes data about:

* species and habitats
* population demographics
* utility services
* energy resources
* marine features
* metrological features
* human health

INSPIRE applies to all Member States and requires public authorities, and organisations which carry out duties on behalf of public authorities, to publish any geographical information they manage that relates to a series of environmental themes defined in the Directive.

INSPIRE complements government open data policy, promotes the reuse of public data and it will enable departments to publish geographical data in formats that can be easily reused by third parties.
